# js-day-todo-app

This is a simple JS project called "Activities Day List" that shows you the current date and day, then you click the "What ...?" button to get your suggestion for the day.

You can see it live here: https://albee-jay.github.io/js-day-todo-app/

I welcome and appreciate any and all comments or help to make this project better.

Thank you, Albert R Juarez
